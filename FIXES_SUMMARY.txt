# FIXES APPLIED - Summary

## 1. ✅ Forgot Password Page Created
- New page: src/pages/ForgotPasswordPage.tsx
- Route added: /forgot-password
- Features:
  - Email validation
  - Success confirmation screen
  - SIH note about demo credentials
  - Back to login navigation
  - Modern gradient design matching landing page

## 2. ✅ Backend Role Field Removed
- File: ideshare/app/api/v1/endpoints/users.py
- Changed: Line 33 - Removed ole=user_data["role"]
- Now uses: user_data.get() for safe access
- Handles both old and new user documents

## 3. 🔄 Action Required: RESTART BACKEND SERVER

The backend code has been updated but you need to restart the server:

`ash
cd rideshare
python main.py
`

## Why the Error Still Appears:

The error "Failed to get user profile: 'role'" happens because:
1. Old user documents in Firestore still have a ole field
2. The backend was trying to access it as user_data["role"]
3. New code now uses user_data.get("role") which is safe

## Solution Applied:

Changed from:
`python
role=user_data["role"]  # ❌ Crashes if role doesn't exist
`

To:
`python
# ✅ Safely handles missing fields
email=user_data.get("email", "")
name=user_data.get("name", "")
phone=user_data.get("phone", "")
`

## Test After Restart:

1. Stop the backend server (Ctrl+C)
2. Restart: cd rideshare && python main.py
3. Try logging in again
4. Should work! ✅
