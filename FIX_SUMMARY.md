# Fix Summary - Role Removal & Forgot Password

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Backend 500 Error: "Failed to get user profile: 'role'"

**Problem:**
- Old user documents in Firestore still have a `role` field
- Backend code was trying to access `user_data["role"]` which crashed for new users without role
- Login failed with 500 Internal Server Error

**Solution:**
- Updated `rideshare/app/api/v1/endpoints/users.py`
- Changed from `user_data["role"]` to safe `user_data.get("field", default)`
- Now handles both old users (with role) and new users (without role)

**Files Changed:**
- `rideshare/app/api/v1/endpoints/users.py` - Line 33, removed role field access
- Made all field access safe with `.get()` method

### 2. ✅ Forgot Password Functionality

**Problem:**
- "Forgot Password" link was not working
- No password reset page existed

**Solution:**
- Created new `ForgotPasswordPage` component
- Added route `/forgot-password`
- Implemented email validation
- Added success confirmation screen
- Included SIH note about demo credentials

**Files Created:**
- `src/pages/ForgotPasswordPage.tsx` - Full password reset UI

**Files Modified:**
- `src/App.tsx` - Added forgot password route

## 🚀 How to Apply Fixes

### Step 1: Restart Backend Server

The backend code has been updated. You **MUST restart the server**:

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
cd rideshare
python main.py
```

### Step 2: Test Login

Try logging in again with:
- **Email:** karanravirajput2@gmail.com
- **Password:** Ka12345678

Should now work! ✅

### Step 3: Test Forgot Password

1. Go to login page
2. Click "Forgot your password?"
3. Enter email
4. See success screen

## 🔧 Optional: Migrate Old Users

If you have old user documents with `role` field in Firestore, you can clean them up:

```bash
cd rideshare
python migrate_remove_role.py
```

This script will:
- ✅ Remove `role` field from all existing users
- ✅ Show migration progress
- ✅ Verify migration success
- ✅ Allow inspecting specific users

**Menu Options:**
1. Run migration (remove 'role' from all users)
2. Verify migration
3. Inspect specific user
4. Exit

## 📝 Technical Details

### Backend Changes

**Before:**
```python
# ❌ This crashes if role doesn't exist
return UserProfile(
    uid=user_id,
    email=user_data["email"],
    name=user_data["name"],
    role=user_data["role"],  # CRASH!
    ...
)
```

**After:**
```python
# ✅ Safe access with defaults
profile_data = {
    "uid": user_id,
    "email": user_data.get("email", ""),
    "name": user_data.get("name", ""),
    "phone": user_data.get("phone", ""),
    "profile_pic": user_data.get("profile_pic", ""),
    "rating": user_data.get("rating", 0.0),
    "created_at": str(user_data.get("created_at", "")),
}
return profile_data
```

### Frontend Changes

**New Page Structure:**
```
src/pages/ForgotPasswordPage.tsx
├── Email input with validation
├── Loading state
├── Success confirmation screen
├── Error handling
├── SIH demo credentials note
└── Navigation links
```

**Route Added:**
```typescript
<Route
  path="/forgot-password"
  element={isAuthenticated ? <Navigate to="/home" replace /> : <ForgotPasswordPage />}
/>
```

## 🐛 Why the Error Happened

### Root Cause:
1. **Original Design:** App had role-based registration (driver/passenger)
2. **Design Change:** Removed role field, added phone field
3. **Old Data:** Existing users in Firestore still had `role` field
4. **Code Issue:** Backend tried to access role with `user_data["role"]`
5. **Result:** KeyError when role didn't exist → 500 error

### How We Fixed It:
- Changed all dictionary access from `user_data["key"]` to `user_data.get("key", default)`
- This safely handles missing fields
- Works for both old and new user documents
- No data loss, backward compatible

## 🎓 For SIH Evaluation Team

### Quick Test:
1. **Login:** Use demo credentials button on login page
2. **Forgot Password:** Click link, test email validation
3. **Success Flow:** See confirmation screen

### Demo Credentials:
```
Email: karanravirajput2@gmail.com
Password: Ka12345678
```

### Note:
Password reset emails are not sent in development mode. The page is fully functional with validation and UI/UX but actual email sending requires SMTP configuration.

## 🔄 Migration Script Usage

### Basic Usage:
```bash
python migrate_remove_role.py
```

### What It Does:
1. Connects to Firestore
2. Scans all user documents
3. Identifies users with `role` field
4. Removes the field
5. Shows progress and summary

### Example Output:
```
🔄 Starting migration: Remove 'role' field from users
📝 User abc12345... has role: driver
   ✅ Removed role field
📝 User def67890... has role: passenger
   ✅ Removed role field

📊 Migration Summary:
Total users processed:  10
Users updated:          2
Users skipped:          8
✅ Migration completed successfully!
```
